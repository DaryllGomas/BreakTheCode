## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Include appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep structure clean and readable

#### CSS
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Maintain existing naming conventions
- Group related styles together
- Comment complex animations or calculations
- Prefer CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Use relative units (rem, em, %, vw, vh) when appropriate

#### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Maintain existing function organization
- Add error handling for robust operation
- Comment complex logic or algorithms
- Avoid external dependencies unless absolutely necessary

### Project Structure

#### Current Architecture
The project currently uses a single-file architecture (`index.html`) containing:
- Complete HTML structure
- Embedded CSS styles
- Inline JavaScript functionality

#### Future Refactoring Plans
When refactoring (Phase 1 roadmap):
```
